=========Mateuss Engine v1.8========
Welcome to Mateuss Engine.
This engine is a HTML/JavaScript engine, that is created from Telerik Engine 2020,
but adds much more features

This file is not necesarry to the Engine, so you can delete it if you want

============================================What Changed:==============================================

This update is just like the others: Medium addition count
But these additions were very useful

Additions:
1. Added Auditor: a simple, yet powerful system of 2 arrays, that allows infinete sounds for your game
2. A bit of dope 8-bit sound effects
3. Friction and Impact resistance to Newtonus Objects
4. Tutorial.txt, that has the explanation of each integrated feature of Mateuss Engine

Changes:
1. Seperated the builders from game.js to features.js, so your code is a bit less long
2. Rewrote Newtonus, so it is much easier to understand and less glitched, but it still has some problems :P

Bug Fixes:
1. Fixed the jittering of a Newtonus object, when it stands on anything (Other body or Floor)
2. Kinda fixed the bug when a Newtonus object is inside another and they start going upwards
3. Fixed bug when an extra heavy object falls on another object it clips through the floor into the backrooms
4. Fixed bug when an object spawns colliding with the celing and instead of falling down it goes up
5. Fixed most other problems, that were in the Mateuss Engine Feature Showcase
6. Fixed rotation being broken
